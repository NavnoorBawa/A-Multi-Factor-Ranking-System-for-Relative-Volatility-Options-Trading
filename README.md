A Multi-Factor Ranking System for Relative Volatility Options Trading
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the theoretical framework for a systematic options trading model. The system is designed to identify and capitalize on temporary discrepancies between the market's expectation of future volatility (Implied Volatility) and the asset's recent, statistically observed volatility (Historical Volatility).

The model does not trade on every signal. Instead, it employs a disciplined, multi-factor ranking methodology to score all potential opportunities and select only the one with the highest strategic alignment and statistical edge on any given day.

2. Core Trading Philosophy
The model's foundation rests on the principle of volatility mean reversion. In financial markets, the price of an option is heavily influenced by its Implied Volatility (IV). This IV is essentially the market's consensus forecast of how much the underlying asset will move in the future.

However, these forecasts are often driven by market sentiment (fear or greed) and can deviate significantly from the asset's actual, measured historical volatility (HV). The core philosophy is that these deviations are often temporary and will correct over time. This model seeks to profit from that correction.

When IV is much higher than HV: The market is likely over-pricing risk. This suggests options are "expensive," creating an opportunity to act as a seller of insurance (i.e., sell options).

When IV is much lower than HV: The market is likely under-pricing risk. This suggests options are "cheap," creating an opportunity to buy them.

3. The Signal Generation and Confirmation Process
A trading opportunity is not based on a single condition but is evaluated through a layered, multi-factor process.

Step 1: The Primary Signal
The process begins by scanning all available options and identifying a primary signal based on the IV/HV relationship described above. This generates a large pool of potential trade candidates.

Step 2: The Confirmation Filters
Each candidate from Step 1 is then passed through a set of confirmation filters to assess the broader market context. This is what makes the model "multi-factor."

Trend Analysis: The model analyzes the underlying asset's price trend (e.g., its position relative to a short-term moving average). The purpose is to ensure the trade is not "fighting the tape." For example, a signal to sell a put option (a bullish-to-neutral bet) is considered stronger if the underlying asset is already in a confirmed uptrend.

Volatility Regime Analysis: The model assesses the current level of Implied Volatility relative to its own past range (e.g., its 52-week high and low). A signal to sell volatility is more attractive when the overall volatility environment is already high, as this suggests there is more "premium" to capture and a higher probability of a decline.

4. The Ranking and Selection Model
This is the intellectual core of the system. Instead of using the confirmation filters as simple on/off switches, the model quantifies the strength of each factor and combines them into a single "Confidence Score" for every potential trade.

On any given day, the system calculates this score for all candidates. It then discards all but the single, highest-scoring opportunity. This disciplined selection process ensures that capital is only deployed on the trade that has the strongest alignment across all strategic factors.

5. Risk and Portfolio Management
A strategy is incomplete without a robust risk management framework. This model integrates a strict set of rules for both entering and exiting positions.

Position Sizing: The size of each trade is calculated as a fixed percentage of the total portfolio value. This ensures that the risk taken on any single trade is consistent and controlled relative to the account size.

Exit Logic: Every open position is continuously monitored for one of three exit conditions:

Stop-Loss: The position is automatically closed if it reaches a pre-defined maximum loss level. This is a critical rule for capital preservation.

Profit-Target: The position is automatically closed once it achieves a pre-defined profit target. This ensures that winning trades are realized and profits are locked in.

Maximum Holding Period: If neither the stop-loss nor the profit-target is hit, the position is automatically closed after a set number of days. This rule prevents holding a position for too long and limits exposure to time-related risks.

6. Performance Evaluation
The system's effectiveness is measured through a comprehensive analysis of simulated trading results. It calculates a full suite of industry-standard metrics, including total return, risk-adjusted return (Sharpe, Sortino), maximum drawdown, and trade-level statistics like win rate and profit factor. This provides a rigorous, data-driven assessment of the strategy's historical performance.
